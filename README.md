# 👀 EyeUn-Slop
---
**What the hell is this?:** A no-bullshit eye break reminder program built on python for developers and users who areconcerned about their eye health but can't tolerate a wake-up like every 20 minutes when they deeply focused on something.

## Why is this special?
---
It is special because of the following features:

* The most important feature of this program is that this program is not *annoying*. Instead of shocking the userwith a sudden *beep* or a wake-up alarm, it simply reduces the brightness of the first monitor of the userby 10 percent with a gentle notification sound for 20 seconds and then turns it back to normal. In this way, it gently notifies the user to take a break instead of occasionally giving the user a unrequested shot of adrenaline, preserving the focus of the user.

* It sends a notification if things go wrong, instead of silently failing in the background.

* **Linux-Exlusive:** On Linux KDE and GNOME desktop environments, it keeps checking whether the screen is locked or not. If the screen is locked in the current session due to user inactivity, it updated the break-reminder timer, such that the user gets the break exactly after 20 minutes after returning from AFK.
